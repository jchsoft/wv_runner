## Finding Information

| Information type | Tool | Example |
|------------------|------|---------|
| **Symbols** (classes, methods) | CodeGraph (`mcp__codegraph__*`) | "find `WorkLoop`" |
| **Modules, concerns, mixins** | **LSP** `documentSymbol` or `Grep` | `module InstructionBuilding` |
| **File structure** (all symbols) | **LSP** `documentSymbol` | complete overview of classes, modules, methods |
| **Who calls/references a symbol** | **LSP** `findReferences` / `incomingCalls` | precise references from known position |
| **Architecture, patterns, lessons learned** | `/memory-search` skill | "how does triage work?" |

**LSP tool is available** (ruby-lsp plugin) — sees modules, concerns, everything CodeGraph misses. Requires file:line position, so first find the file via CodeGraph/Grep, then analyze via LSP.
**CodeGraph limitation for Ruby:** Does not index `module` definitions (concerns, namespace modules).

## LLM Memory Notes MCP Usage
- Memory identifier for this project: `wv-runner` (contains architecture, patterns, commands, testing info)
- **Search**: Use `/memory-search` skill (runs on Haiku, returns compact filtered results)
- **Do NOT use direct `ReadMcpResourceTool`** for searching — returns too verbose data into context

## WorkVector
- Project name is: WorkVector
- project_relative_id=7

## Large File Token Cost Prevention
- **Never read full file (>200 lines) more than once per session.** After first read, use `offset`+`limit` for subsequent access.
- **Batch all edits to same file in single turn.** Multiple sequential edits on large file = each turn re-sends entire conversation history with file contents embedded = massive token waste.
- **Before editing large file (>500 lines), consider splitting it first** — extract methods/classes into smaller files, then edit those.
- **Real cost example:** Research phase cost $2, then repeated edits on large files ballooned to $17 because each edit re-sent full file content through context.

## CI & Quality Checks
- **Full CI**: `ruby bin/ci` runs all checks (tests, RuboCop, Reek, Flay)
- **Tests only**: `ruby test_runner.rb` runs all tests
- **Individual tests**: `ruby -I lib -I test test/services/<test_file>.rb`
- **All checks must pass before committing changes**

## Version Management
**Important**: After successfully completing this wv_runner task (when code is committed and ready):
- Run: `ruby bin/increment_version.rb` to increment the wv_runner version by 0.1
- This ONLY increments the wv_runner version itself, not projects where runner is used
- Version file: `lib/wv_runner/version.rb`
- Current version is displayed at startup with every run
- Versions follow pattern: 0.1.0 → 0.1.1 → 0.1.2 → ... → 0.1.9 → 0.2.0 → 0.2.1 → etc
- Run this command AFTER you've committed your code changes
- Example: After implementing a feature, commit your code, then run `ruby bin/increment_version.rb` before ending the task
