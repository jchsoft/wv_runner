             - IF feature branch:
               a) Extract task ID from branch name (e.g. "feature/9508-contact-page" → 9508)
                  Found → read mcptask://pieces/jchsoft/{task_id}
               b) No ID → check PR: gh pr list --head $(git branch --show-current) --json body --jq '.[0].body'
                  Look for mcptask.online link → extract task ID → load task
               c) Still nothing → #{pull_cmd} → step 2
               d) CHECK PROGRESS (if task found):
                  - progress >= 100 or state "Schváleno"/"Hotovo?" → #{pull_cmd} → step 2
                  - progress < 100 → RESUME: TASKRUNNER_TASK_INFO, SKIP steps 2-3, go to step 4

          CODING CONVENTIONS (MANDATORY):

            ✅ git commit -m "Fix login validation for empty emails"
            ❌ git commit -m "$(echo 'Fix login')"
            Multi-line → heredoc:

            Your message here.
            EOF

             Read BEFORE logging work progress#{warning}
          2. Task "duration_best" → task_estimated (e.g. "1 hodina" → 1.0)

          PROGRESS LOGGING (MANDATORY — min 3× LogWorkProgressTool calls during run):
          - Single 100% call at end = UNACCEPTABLE. Caller sees no interim state.
          - Milestones (minimum cadence, bump progress_percent each time):
            a) After branch created + task understood → ~20%
            b) After implementation + unit tests pass → ~60%
            c) After PR/CI done → 100%
          - Each call: duration_minutes = minutes since previous call (not cumulative);
            description = what was done since last log.
          - More calls OK for long tasks; 3× is floor, not target.

      def context_optimization_instruction
        <<~INSTRUCTION.strip
          CONTEXT OPTIMIZATION (MANDATORY):
          - Call independent tools in parallel (Read/Grep/Glob in one turn)
          - CodeGraph/LSP BEFORE Read/Grep for exploration
          - If CodeGraph unavailable, LSP as primary:
            * documentSymbol — file structure
            * findReferences — callers
            * definition — jump to def
            * incomingCalls — call graph
          - Never re-read same file >2×. Use offset+limit for re-reads.

          OUTPUT EFFICIENCY (MANDATORY — saves ~65% tokens):
          - Drop filler: just/really/basically/actually/simply/certainly
          - Drop pleasantries: "Sure!"/"Happy to help"/"Let me..."/"I'll proceed to..."
          - No hedging: maybe/perhaps/might be worth
          - Short fragments. Pattern: [thing] [action] [reason].
          - NEVER explain what you're about to do — do it. Never narrate tool calls.
          - NEVER summarize what you did — user sees diff.
          - Technical terms exact. Code blocks unchanged. Errors quoted exact.
          - TASKRUNNER_RESULT JSON unchanged — rules apply to natural language only.
          - ALWAYS respond in English — even when task description is in Czech or other language.

          TIME MANAGEMENT (CRITICAL):
          - Target: 90 min. Kill: 20 min inactive (no stream output).
          - Producing output = safe.
          - >70 min elapsed → SKIP full tests/CI. Run targeted tests only → TASKRUNNER_RESULT.
          - ALWAYS output TASKRUNNER_RESULT when done.
