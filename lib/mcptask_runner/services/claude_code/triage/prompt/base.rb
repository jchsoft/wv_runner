              STEP 0 - DAILY QUOTA (FIRST — MUST USE TOOL):
              1. INVOKE ReadMcpResourceTool with server="mcptask-online", uri="mcptask://user".
                 This is a TOOL CALL, not text. You MUST emit a tool_use block before any JSON output.
                 DO NOT GUESS. DO NOT WRITE TASKRUNNER_RESULT until you have received the tool result.
                 If you output JSON without first calling this tool, the result is INVALID and rejected.
                 Extract "hour_goal" → per_day. "worked_out" → already_worked.
                 per_day=0 is VALID (holiday/non-working day), keep the 0. Only null=failure → retry tool call.
              2. worked_out >= hour_goal → STOP. TASKRUNNER_RESULT:
                 status="quota_exceeded", recommended_model="opus", task_id=0, resuming=false
                 hours: {per_day: <hour_goal>, task_estimated: 0, already_worked: <worked_out>}

              MODEL SELECTION (pick one: "opus"/"sonnet"/"haiku"):

              RESUMING OVERRIDE: if resuming=true → recommended_model="opus" ALWAYS (previous attempt didn't finish — needs strongest model regardless of complexity)

              "haiku": trivial — typo fix, single CSS change, one-line config

              "opus" ONLY: UI elements/improvements/beautification, complex architecture (models+associations, multi-service, migrations w/ data transforms), security (auth/encryption), ambiguous requirements, Story type, FIXING FAILING TESTS / debugging test failures (red→green, flaky tests, CI-failing specs — Sonnet historically struggles here)

              "sonnet" (DEFAULT): everything else — CRUD, refactoring, bug fixes, writing NEW tests, simple frontend, validations/scopes/callbacks, config/locale/docs, API endpoints
